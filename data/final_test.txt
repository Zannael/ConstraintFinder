students enrolled in recognized degree programmes within the limits of the funds available.

and to make it easier for them to attend their courses, DiSCo provides accommodation in suitable
facilities, according to the available spaces for a maximum of ten months and anyway until no later than
July 31, 2022.
Available accommodations may vary during the academic year covered by this call for
applications, therefore any changes in the ranking will be announced to the students through their
personal account on the website. 
The merit-based requirement is assessed based on the year of enrolment, the credits earned, and the
exams passed.

specified above are lowered by 10%.
Students enrolled in Lazio-based Universities, who simultaneously attend the courses under Ministerial

The maximum number of bonus credits is determined by the year of first use.
the number of required credits/exams is calculated based on the years of enrolment from the
year of first enrolment in the degree programme prior to the change/transfer.
DiSCo reserves the right to carry out all the checks deemed necessary with the various Universities,
also with reference to any previous academic careers.
University enrolment fees are refunded by the University a student is enrolled at.

First-year students with disabilities are not required to achieve a minimum number
of credits.
A duly documented application for the deadline extension must be submitted to DiSCo before the

in the application in addition to the exam-based credits.
These credits must be certified by the
